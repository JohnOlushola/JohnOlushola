### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m taking the joy of creating landing pages of all Apple devices I own. Feel free to fork and tweak to whatever ideas you have, and yes PRs are always welcome in fact I would love them. 

Frontend developer during by day, Artificial intelligence student by night. Itâ€™s reverse sometimes ðŸ˜Ž

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on recreating some Apple product websites
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun open-source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music, gym and cars
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: It's 2021 but send me an e-mail ðŸ˜„
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are two types of PR, Push Requests and Personal Recods (If you know, you know!)
